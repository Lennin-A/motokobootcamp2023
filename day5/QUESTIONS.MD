1) False, the heap is always erased but you can save the data into stable memory and postupgrade will bring the data from stable back to heap 

2) Depends on where the cansiters are located, it they are in the same subnet and A B C are different canisters (4secs) OR 12 secs if in different subnets 

3) No because intercanister calls use update calls. So be querying another canister it will be inside an update call
